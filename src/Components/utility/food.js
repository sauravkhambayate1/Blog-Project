about : "A dish popular across the Middle East, Kebabs are originally from Turkey. The bacon idea came from Middle Eastern kebab cookery. Turkish chefs skewer slices of pure lamb fat between lamb chunks before grilling. The fat melts during cooking, continually basting the lean meat. We were working with chicken here, so lamb didn’t quite fit. But we could think of another fatty, more complementary meat: bacon.",
